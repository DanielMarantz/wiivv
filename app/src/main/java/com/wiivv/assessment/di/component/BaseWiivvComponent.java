 * @Component: Components basically are injectors, letâ€™s say a bridge between @Inject and @Module, which its main responsibility is to
 * put both together. They just give you instances of all the types you defined, for example, we must annotate an interface with @Component
 * and list all the @Modules that will compose that component, and if any of them is missing, we get errors at compile time.
 * All the components are aware of the scope of dependencies it provides through its modules.
 *
 * @Singleton is annotation for scope control. The scope defines the alive range for the dependency. In here is Application scope.
